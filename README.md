## Prerequisites

In order for this code to run you must first download and install:

*    `zonemap3d`: https://github.com/inconvergent/zonemap-3d

## Other Dependencies

The code also depends on:

*    `blender` (must be installed, and the path added to `./settings` files)
*    `numpy`
*    `scipy`
*    `cython`

## Running it on Linux (Ubuntu)

To install the libraries locally, run `install`. I have only tested this
code in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but my guess is that it should work on most other
platforms as well.  However i know that the scripted install in
`install` will not work in Windows

## Running it on Windows?

The code will probably work just fine under Windows, but I'm not sure how to
install it. (Let me know if you get it working!)
